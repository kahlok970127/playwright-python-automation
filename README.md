# SauceDemo Playwright Automation Testing

## Project Description

This project is an automated testing framework built with **Playwright** and **Pytest**.

The purpose of this project is to automate the testing of the SauceDemo web application. The test suite covers the complete user shopping journey, including login, product inventory, shopping cart, checkout process, order completion, and PDF report download functionality.

This project follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

cd playwright-python-automation
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
playwright install
```

---

## Run Tests

Run all test cases:

```bash
pytest
```

Run tests with detailed output:

```bash
pytest -v
```

Generate HTML report:

```bash
pytest --html=reports/report.html
```

---

## Test Report

After test execution, an HTML report will be generated.

The report includes:

- Test case results
- Pass/fail status
- Test execution duration
- Execution details

Example:

```
Passed: 44
Failed: 0
```

## Framework Design

This project uses the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.

Structure:

- Page classes contain web elements and page actions.
- Test files contain test scenarios and assertions.
- `conftest.py` manages reusable fixtures and test setup.

This structure improves maintainability and allows the framework to be extended with additional test scenarios.

---

## Learning Objectives

This project was created to practice and demonstrate:

- Playwright fundamentals
- Web element locators
- Page Object Model design
- Pytest fixtures
- Test automation framework design
- Automated UI testing practices

---

## Notes

This repository demonstrates automated testing practices using Playwright and Pytest.

The framework can be extended with additional test scenarios and improvements.
